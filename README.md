# pivpn_gui_for_openvpn
this is a simple .py gui for connecting and disconnecting from your pivpn running openvpn vs using trminal commands 
every time. when connecting on linux you need to use terminal, importing the .ovpn file into network manager dose not 
work correctly . 


open .py file and replace your filepath and file name. and add your sudo name, sudo pass word, and you pivpn password
that relates to you .ovpn file.  let me know if there is any changes that i should make.
